Do not provide any explanation.\n\nDocument:\nIn Wales, councils are responsible for funding and overseeing schools.\nBut in England, Mr Osborne's plan will mean local authorities will cease to have a role in providing education.\nAcademies are directly funded by central government and head teachers have more freedom over admissions and to change the way the school works.\nIt is a significant development in the continued divergence of schools systems on either side of Offa's Dyke.\nAnd although the Welsh Government will get extra cash to match the money for English schools to extend the school day, it can spend it on any devolved policy area.\nMinisters have no plans to follow suit.\nAt the moment, governing bodies are responsible for setting school hours and they need ministerial permission to make significant changes.\nThere are already more than 2,000 secondary academies in England and its extension to all state schools is unlikely to shake the Welsh Government's attachment to what they call a \"community, comprehensive model\" for schools.\nIt rejects claims that freedom given to academies can help drive up standards, and it points to academy-free Scotland as the best performing school system in the UK.\nEducation Minister Huw Lewis said there was \"very little evidence to suggest\" academies have a positive impact in driving up standards and Wales would not be following the model.\n\"The Tories have wasted hundreds of millions of pounds on academies and free schools and as the Chancellor finalises his budget plans to slash vital services even further, he is committing them to wasting even more on a failing endeavour.\n\"We have no plans to introduce the chaos and waste of academies and free schools here in Wales.\"\nNone of the main parties in May's Assembly election - including the Welsh Conservatives - have said they want to introduce academies in Wales.\nOwen Hathway, NUT Cymru's policy officer, called the academy plans for England \"scandalous.\".\n\"There is no evidence that academies work, no evidence that they raise standards, no evidence that they offer better quality education and no evidence that they are what parents and communities want,\" he said.\n\"Certainly a commitment to comprehensive education is something we would want, and indeed expect, all parties to hold firm to in their manifestos for the forthcoming Welsh election.\"\nBut the Welsh and English schools systems are still linked by a joint arrangement for teachers' pay and conditions.\nAcademies are not tied to these pay scales so in effect Wednesday's announcement will take all English schools out of the system and raise questions about the viability of an England and Wales pay and conditions structure.\nThere is already growing momentum for the devolution of teachers' pay and conditions.\nOriginally sceptical, the Welsh Labour Government is now broadly in favour.\nSome teaching unions remain opposed because of concern that Welsh teachers would end up being paid less than those in England.\nMr Hathway said teachers were concerned it could lead to regional pay.\n\"At the same time we do of course recognise that the issue of pay is already becoming a grey area due to the negative changes we see taking place in England,\" he said.\nBut an even bigger difference between the schools landscape on either side of the border, appears to make separate arrangements for pay increasingly likely in future.\n\nOptions:\nA. English schools are becoming academies while Wales sticks to its system.\nB. The announcement by Chancellor George Osborne that all English state schools will transition into academies marks a significant divergence from the Welsh approach, where councils remain responsible for funding and overseeing schools, and the Welsh Government has no plans to adopt this model despite receiving additional funding, and there are growing concerns about regional pay for teachers.\nC. The weather in Wales is often rainy and unpredictable, affecting outdoor activities.\nD. As Chancellor George Osborne announced all English state schools will become academies, the Welsh Government continues to reject the model here.\n\nResponse:",

An unbelievable climax to the league season!\"\nManchester City 0-1 Luton, 1983\nLong before Paul Dickov's play-off final goal at Wembley in 1999 or Sergio Aguero's Premier League title-winner in 2012, Manchester City found themselves on the wrong end of some late drama.\nCity only needed a draw with Luton at Maine Road to ensure top-flight survival, while the Hatters needed to win to stay up and send City down.\nAs full-time approached, Raddy Antic fired in the from the edge of the penalty area to put the visitors ahead.\n\"Has Luton's life in the harsh world of the English First Division been saved by a Yugoslav?\" asked BBC commentator John Motson.\nYes it had, and who can forget the sight of Luton manager David Pleat racing onto the pitch to celebrate with his players?\nBrentford 0-1 Doncaster, 2013\nHow joy can turn to despair, and vice versa, in 18 seconds. Brentford fans and Marcello Trotta - look away now.\nDoncaster began the final day of the League One season needing a draw at Griffin Park to be promoted.

Since 2010, we have increased funding for early intervention to \u00a32.4bn to help them meet local need.\"\nThe Local Government Association, which represents councils in England, said the past five years had seen about a 40% reduction in the overall amount central government provides for children's services.\n\"This has had consequences for children's centres and other services councils provide,\" said David Simmonds, chairman of the LGA's Children and Young People Board.\n\"We welcome the fact that more children and families are using children's centres but at a time when budgets are stretched there are limits to what can be achieved when councils are having to serve more families and children with less money.\"\n\nOptions:\nA. According to Barnardo's analysis of government figures, funding for children's centres in England has decreased by 35% over five years, prompting concerns about the impact on support services for families, which are essential for the well-being of vulnerable children.\nB. Funding for children's centres has decreased.\nC. Support for vulnerable children in England is at risk as funding ebbs away, according to a charity's analysis of government figures.\nD.

It is thought that the court may not reach a decision before the end of 2015.\nSpeaking to reporters on Sunday, Philippine Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario said that more than 40 maps and \"nearly 4,000 pages\" of evidence had been submitted to the tribunal.\n\"It is about defending what is legitimately ours... it is about guaranteeing freedom of navigation for all nations,\" he said, adding that it would help \"preserve regional peace, security and stability\".\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said last week that China would not accept the arbitration, and that the Philippines should \"stop going any further down the wrong track so as to avoid further damage to bilateral relations\".\nChina was \"committed to managing and resolving relevant issues... through dialogue and consultation,\" he added.\nOn Saturday, a Philippine government ship slipped past Chinese coast guard vessels to reach the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, known as Ayungin in Manila and Ren'ai Reef in Beijing.\nPhilippine troops are stationed on a beached, rusting military ship that analysts say has become a symbol of the country marking its territory.\nOn 9 March, China prevented two Philippine vessels from reaching the shoal. Philippine officials said the ships carried supplies for the troops on the shoal, but China said the ships carried construction supplies.\nFollowing the incident, Philippine planes air dropped supplies onto the shoal.\n\nOptions:\nA. The Philippines, amidst escalating tensions with China over territorial claims in the South China Sea, has submitted a vast amount of evidence, including over 40 maps and nearly 4,000 pages of documentation, to a UN tribunal as part of its arbitration case against China's assertions, which the Philippines deems illegal under international law.\nB.

Georgians maintained their faith over the centuries despite the waves of invading hordes, including the armies of Ghengis Khan and Tamerlane.\nAlthough the Soviets permitted religion to be practised, its reach was severely limited. In 1917, there were 2,455 working churches in Georgia, but by the mid-1980s there were only 80, along with a few monasteries and a seminary.\n\"During communism, the church was outdated, something for old ladies,\" says political analyst Ghia Nodia.\nThat attitude quickly changed after independence in 1991, when the elected president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, espoused a philosophy of ethnic nationalism, which the Church embraced.\n\"During the (Gamsakhurdia) national movement, the concept that real Georgians are Orthodox Christians spread really fast,\" Mr Nodia says.\nOver 80% of Georgia's 4.5 million people say they belong to the Georgian Orthodox Church, however, experts claim only about 15% - 25% actively participate in rituals.\nNevertheless, the Orthodox Church remains the most trusted institution in Georgia. In a February survey carried out by the Caucasus Resource Research Center (CRRC), 95% of respondents had a favourable opinion of its work.\nBeka Mindiashvili, a former theologian who is now head of the Tolerance Center at the public defender's office, attributes such high confidence in the Church to the 80-year-old Patriarch, Ilia II.\n\"He possesses all the right attributes. He is charismatic, he speaks slowly and each word is regarded saintly, holy,\" Mr Mindiashvili says.\n\"He is a person for everybody. To a simple person, he speaks simply; to a politician, he speaks politically; to an intellectual, he speaks of Umberto Eco and of classical music. And he acquired absolute power in the Church all by himself.\"\nThere were only about 50 priests when Ilia II became patriarch in 1977. Today there are approximately 1,700.\nHis first major test in power was in 1997, when a number of anti-ecumenical abbots threatened to break communion with him for being too liberal. He avoided a schism by breaking off ecumenical activities and pursuing what philosopher Zaza Piralishvili calls an \"imitation of medieval rhetoric\".\nExamples of the Church's ultra-conservative interventions included warnings that yoga was full of false \"charms\" that lured people away from God as well as a recent mass mobilisation against ID cards after some Georgian Orthodox leaders claimed the cards bore the mark of the anti-Christ.\nThe Church is recognised for maintaining a neutral political stance and Ilia II is renowned for playing a significant role as mediator in political confrontations, which in Georgia can easily turn violent.\nProfessor Iago Kachkachishvili, head of the sociology department at Tbilisi State University, says the Church's political neutrality is a myth.\n\"The Church's influence comes from public opinion,\" he says. \"It uses the trust of the people as a source of strength. And every government and politician uses the Georgian Orthodox Church as a source of legitimacy.\"\nWhile the constitution stipulates a separation between church and state, a 2002 concordat defined this relationship by granting the Church official recognition in Georgia and a special consultative role in the government, particularly in education.\nIn 2009, Mikheil Saakashvili's government awarded the Church a $15m (\u00c2\u00a310m) grant - three times the amount of the previous year - and presented luxury sports utility vehicles to each of the 10 archbishops.\nDespite the lavish gifts, many conservative elements within the Church, who are pro-Russian, openly voiced their displeasure with the president. They saw his pro-Western orientation as a threat to Georgian traditions and the Church's influence on the people.\nThe clash of ideologies came to head in July 2011, when parliament passed a law allowing religious minority groups in Georgia to be registered as legal entities in public law giving them legal protection previously only enjoyed by the Orthodox Church.\nThe move was applauded in the West, but the Georgian Orthodox Church saw this as an infringement on its special status.\nAlthough Ilia II requested the clergy to maintain neutrality in the 2012 parliamentary elections, many priests broke ranks and openly supported the coalition of billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, who had provided the funds to build Tbilisi's Sameba Cathedral, the largest church in Georgia.\nBut on 13 May, Bidzina Ivanishvili who by now was prime minister, took an independent stance and became the first Georgian politician to declare openly that sexual minorities were equal citizens of this country.\nThree days later, Ilia II called on the authorities to ban the 17 May demonstration. This marked the first open confrontation between church and state and culminated in expletive-shouting priests chasing gay activists down the main streets of the capital.\nProtesters broke through barricades and police were forced to bus the small number of activists out of the area for their protection.\nThe day after the attacks, Tbilisi artist Magda Guruli joined some 100 people who rallied in the city centre to call for justice.\nShe believes the response to the protest was a manifestation of the patriarch's power over the state.\n\"I'm here to say give me back my religion,\" she said. \"Orthodoxy is part of our culture, but who are these people who try to influence society and try to influence their thoughts and try to cultivate blind faith?\"\n\nOptions:\nA. In Tbilisi, a violent incident occurred when dozens of Orthodox priests led a large crowd in attacking gay rights activists, shocking many Georgians, who generally pride themselves on their hospitality and Christian values, despite the deep-seated conservatism surrounding issues of sexuality and the influential role of the Orthodox Church in society.\nB. The Georgian hills are famous for their beautiful landscapes and rich history.\nC. Georgian priests attacked gay activists in Tbilisi.\nD. When several dozen Georgian Orthodox priests led tens of thousands of people on a violent attack against a small group of gay rights activists in Tbilisi earlier this year, much of the rest of the country was horrified, writes journalist Paul Rimple, who has been based in the country for 10 years.\n\nResponse:",

In the lead-up to the EU referendum, the Office for National Statistics reported a significant decline in construction output, reversing April's gains and raising concerns about the impact on the wider economy, with housing construction experiencing its largest drop since early 2014 and overall output falling by 1.9% annually.\n\nResponse:"

The purpose and ramifications of this attack are not clear,\" the Eritrean government said in a short statement issued on Sunday night.\nIt does not mention any casualties.\nEthiopia's Information Minister Getachew Reda, who is out of the country, told the BBC he was not aware of the fighting.\nAs part of the Algiers peace agreement signed in 2000 both countries agreed to accept the ruling of an independent boundary commission over the location of the frontier as \"final and binding\".\nBut after the commission ruled that the disputed town of Badme, where the conflict began, was in Eritrea, Ethiopia at first refused to agree to the border demarcation and then called for dialogue before it would implement the decision.\nThis was rejected by Eritrea and there has been an impasse ever since, although clashes have been rare.\n\nOptions:\nA. There is fighting at the border.\nB. Ethiopia has not made a statement regarding the fighting in the Tsorona area, where residents reported gunfire and troop movements, while tensions remain high since a peace deal was signed in 2000 but not fully implemented, leading to accusations and threats from both countries' leaders without clarity on the current outbreak of violence.\nC. The weather in Ethiopia is typically warm and dry during the summer months.\nD. Eritrea has accused Ethiopia of launching an attack at the countries' heavily-militarised border.\n\nResponse:",

We could have won, could have lost.

February retail sales jumped 10.9% from the previous year.\nWhile we should always remain sceptical of the Chinese government's GDP data, these figures suggest that growth is stabilising.\nHowever, they also demonstrate that Beijing is relying on the same old tricks to drive its economy.\nGovernment spending on infrastructure, a booming property market and taking on debt were all things China's leadership has pledged to move away from in the transition towards a new, modern, open economy.\nYet all three factors are still evident in this data, suggesting that the \"old\" model of growth that relies so much on the state is alive and well.\nDebt is a particular concern. China's total and private debt is now worth more than 250% of GDP and looks set to grow. Analysts are divided about just how equipped China is to handle that much debt, but even the government has said the situation is not ideal and must be addressed.\nThe question is just how much political appetite there will be to accept a less-than-glamorous growth rate in a year when President Xi Jinping has arguably his most important party congress coming up.\nChina is a key driver of the global economy and its performance is closely watched by investors around the world. Its 2016 growth was its slowest in 26 years.\nHidenobu Tokuda of the Mizuho Research Institute in Tokyo said China should be trying to slow its growth rate in the long term, though \"uncertainties remain high\" about how that slowdown would happen.\nMeanwhile Brian Jackson of IHS Global Insight predicted both industrial output and the property sector would slow.\n\nOptions:\nA. Penguins can swim for miles without getting tired.\nB. China's economy is doing well.\nC.

FBI Director James Comey's last-minute letter to Congress about new Clinton emails?\nAnything but acknowledge that Donald Trump turned out to be the more effective candidate with a more appealing message (at least in the states that mattered).\nRussian government hackers are the latest culprit - or scapegoat, depending on one's perspective. They're a tempting target, however, given the latest accounts of intrigue from intelligence community sources. A wily Vladimir Putin overseeing damaging leaks makes for a deliciously villainous plot.\nOf course those campaign emails, while certainly an annoyance to Democrats, likely weren't enough to tilt the election. But that doesn't mean these revelations won't be a headache for a president-elect who bristles when challenged.\nNow he's feuding with his own intelligence services and lashing out on Twitter, virtually guaranteeing more leaks. A congressional investigation seems likely. There's even talk of a Russian sanctions bill ending up on President Trump's desk.\nMrs Clinton's loss still stings, but for forlorn Democrats seeing Mr Trump squirm would be a salve for open wounds.\n\nOptions:\nA. US President Barack Obama has vowed to take action against Russia for its alleged interference in the US presidential election campaign.\nB. Obama says the US will act against Russia.\nC. President Obama stated that the US would take action against Russia for their alleged hacking of Democratic emails, which has been dismissed by both Russian officials and president-elect Trump, while intelligence agencies claim to have evidence of Russian involvement in the election interference, leading to ongoing discussions about potential sanctions and investigations.\nD. Hillary Clinton loves puppies and enjoys long walks on the beach.\n\nResponse:",

The federation has been so supportive, we were given everything we needed: uniforms or equipment.\n\"It was tough but us players we had faith and determination - and our spirit motivated us.\"\nKinuthia also revealed the players were driven by their belief they were good enough to qualify - despite their lowly Fifa ranking of 133rd in the world - and also by a desire to shown those Kenyans who are critical of women's football that the sport is not solely for men.\n\"We told each other we would qualify if we were given the chance,\" she said. \"We know Kenya ladies have the talent, we just lack exposure.\n\"We wanted to make people realise that women can make it and since last year we have been singing a song 'women will qualify first before the men'.\n\"For the first time it has happened. In the past it was all about the Harambee Stars but now it is about the Harambee Starlets.\"\nThis is a turning point for Kenya women's football\nKinuthia is not content to sit back and revel in the team's achievement. She is eager for the team to use qualification as a platform for greater success.\n\"Now we have qualified for the Nations Cup I think we will improve the Fifa ranking and we will perform better,\" she said.\n\"Our target is to finish in the top four at the tournament and book our place at the the 2019 World Cup.\"\nTeam manager Doreen Nabwire is working on a plan to make that dream come true.\n\"This is a turning point for Kenya women's football, \" she said.\n\"We are planning for a domestic league, which is supposed to be kick off next month and I hope the players will have adequate time to prepare.\n\"The league will help the players to prepare, allowing them to play at the highest level and to compete, ensuring their fitness levels are maintained.\n\"The president of the federation is also trying to organise a training camp for two or three weeks, in Japan, China, Germany or the USA.\n\"The plans are under way, we also want to move around the country playing friendly matches - against boys or girls - and ensure we are active.\n\"Our team is young, we have maybe two experienced players, but we believe our young players have what it takes to take us to the next level.\"\n\nOptions:\nA. The captain of the Kenya women's team enjoys baking and often makes cakes for her teammates.\nB. The Kenya women's national team, known as the Harambee Starlets, has achieved the remarkable feat of qualifying for the 2016 Africa Women Cup of Nations, overcoming challenges both on and off the field, including lack of support from their communities and the absence of a domestic league, and they aim to improve their FIFA ranking through this opportunity and their passion for the sport.\nC. \"Sometimes our communities have not supported girls to play football, it is considered a man's game.\"\nD.

We dominated the ball, the chances and the play.\n\"We limited them to hardly any possession second half, so to get hit on the sucker punch is very difficult to take.\n\"We've not deserved to lose that game, but that's football.

from high-end vehicles with comprehensive branding, to extensive catering for the masses and cash allowances for the thousands of delegates who attended.\nBut now the hard work begins - to ensure baby Jubilee lives up to expectation and delivers political victory for its parents.\nPrior to Saturday, Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto were living in what Kenyans call a \"come-we-stay\" relationship - an unofficial marriage that has not been endorsed by the parents.\nThe pair came together informally in early 2011 when the rival communities they represent decided to bury their differences, which were at their most destructive when hundreds of people died and thousands others were displaced following the disputed elections of 2007.\nThe two men went on joint rallies across the country to preach peace and heal the bitter rift between their two communities.\nThe rallies then took on an urgent stride as both men faced charges of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court (ICC).\nThe cases were later dropped.\nMr Kenyatta's political parent is The National Alliance (TNA), which he used to secure the presidency in 2013, while Mr Ruto became his deputy running under his own United Republican Party (URP).\nTNA and URP are now dead and Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto are one - assuming the roles of Jubilee party leader and deputy respectively.\nNow Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto have to attend to the duties every parent faces - ensuring baby Jubilee is vaccinated against all forms of political threats and gets a good education to attain the grades needed to secure victory in the 2017 election.\nOn the face it, Jubilee appears to be a platform to simply retain power in a convincing win next year.\nTo do this Jubilee needed to have more national outlook beyond its mainly Kikuyu and Kalenjin core support.\nAnd so Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto have been on a sustained charm offensive to parts of the country and communities that tend to support the opposition such as the Coastal region.\nJoseph Warungu:\n\"The new party is really about one man and one issue: William Ruto and the 2022 general election.\"\nThe harvest was plentiful.\nTwelve parties folded up, gave up their identity and turned red - the colour of Jubilee.\nMore than 40 opposition legislators suddenly found reason to reject the parties that sent them to parliament or the Senate and decided that east or west Jubilee was best.\nThe Jubilee party is now confident that it is ready to take on the opposition in next year's election.\nThey are so confident that in his party launch address, President Kenyatta told the main opposition Cord coalition, led by Raila Odinga, that they should \"get their act together so that we can face one another in a peaceful manner [during the election]\".\nCord is yet to name its presidential candidate.\nBut at a deeper level the new party is really about one man and one issue: William Ruto and the 2022 general election.\nHe, more than President Kenyatta, will need this new platform the most.\nMany observers argue that although the real brutal and unpredictable competition will be at the local county level, at national level President Kenyatta himself is in a strong position to win re-election in 2017 for several reasons.\nHis Jubilee party has very deep pockets and continues to command wide support from the Kikuyu and Kalenjin - the two communities that have been the only ones to occupy the presidency since the country's independence in 1963.\nJubilee is in government and that comes with its advantages.\nJubilee has also made some inroads into parts of the opposition territory to woo other communities, and is working round the clock to try and deliver some of the commitments it made in its 2013 election manifesto.\nBut most importantly, the opposition has not taken political advantage of some of Jubilee's failures including its poor record in fighting corruption, weak rule of law and the continued growth of nepotism and tribalism in public appointments.\nMr Kenyatta has one more thing going for him - very few African incumbents lose elections. When they do, it's out of carelessness or empty pockets.\nSo Mr Ruto is looking beyond 2017 to the 2022 election, when he is meant to replace Mr Kenyatta as the Jubilee presidential candidate.\nHe needs the new binding Jubilee platform because he cannot fully trust his Kikuyu political \"in-laws\" to back him the way he's backed them up to now.\nIn the recent past there were prominent Kikuyu politicians who openly said Mr Ruto should not count on automatic Kikuyu support when his turn comes.\nSecondly Kenyan politicians can be restless grasshoppers - jumping from party to party depending on where the grass is greenest.\nThe new Jubilee platform and a new law that prevents such party political hopping means those inside Jubilee will be locked in.\nThirdly, Mr Ruto is a bold politician who has a single focus on the big picture ahead.\nHis fearless march tends to leave bruised souls who would jump at any opportunity to oppose him.\nHis planning therefore is meticulous and does not leave things to chance.\nIn addition to the Jubilee platform, there is widespread talk in Kenya that he has placed his allies in key public institutions.\nSo with the birth of baby Jubilee, Mr Ruto and Mr Kenyatta are now in the business of changing diapers and buying lots of toys for the baby to ensure they themselves don't see red at the next election.\nMore from Joseph Warungu:\n\nOptions:\nA. In our series of letters from African journalists, social commentator Joseph Warungu asks why Kenya's governing coalition has launched its new Jubilee Party.\nB. Elephants are known for their incredible memory and complex social structures.\nC. Kenyatta and Ruto have formed the Jubilee Party.\nD. After years of political collaboration, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto have formalized their alliance with the launch of the Jubilee Party, aiming for electoral success in 2017 amidst a backdrop of community tensions and past legal challenges, while also needing to ensure the party's broader appeal beyond its core Kikuyu and Kalenjin support.\n\nResponse:",

The occupants of each got out and three items were taken from the lorry.\nThe handover was witnessed by police.\nThe items were later found to be 40kg of cannabis, 1kg of cocaine and 25kg of benzocaine, a mixing agent for cocaine.\nAt the same time, police observed a Vauxhall Astra parked outside a house in Park Avenue, Cookstown.\nPaul Currie was seen carrying items to this car, which was stopped shortly after moving off.\nSearches at a number of properties in Cookstown led to the recovery of \u00a382,000 in cash.\nA search of a house in Lammy Lane, Dessertmartin, which is connected to Currie Snr, uncovered 11kg of cannabis resin and 3kg of herbal cannabis.\nThe detective pointed out that, whilst Currie Jnr has a very limited record, his father has multiple drugs convictions, and has served a total of 16 years in prison for such offences.\nHe said police \"place the men high in an organised crime grouping, although we believe there are others higher\".\n\"Class A drug use is inherently on the rise in Northern Ireland, with needle exchanges high and three drug-related deaths in the Mid-Ulster area in recent weeks,\" he added.\nAt this point, the detective was interrupted by defence counsel for both men, who argued the information was not related to his clients' cases and should not be put forward.\nHowever, the judge allowed the detective to continue, ruling \"such comments are in the public interest\".\nThe detective added: \"I am trying to say there is a safety concern for the public. Both men are unemployed, but they clearly have funds to buy drugs.\n\"Police believe there is a strong likelihood of reoffending and feel there are no bail conditions which could prevent further offending. Police feel that, if bailed, they will return to offending to support themselves financially.\"\nThe judge agreed to release Stephen Currie on strict terms, including a \u00a35,000 surety.\nHe is also ordered to have no contact with Loughlin, not to leave Northern Ireland and to surrender his passport.\nThe judge refused Currie Snr bail, citing concerns he is \"wedded to a career as drug dealer\".\nThe case is due back in court on 21 December.\n\nOptions:\nA.

His Hawking starts askew - the glasses, maybe the shoulders a touch - and over the course of two hours contorts and buckles into a figure at once instantly familiar and fresh.

As one of American Sniper's producers, he will receive an Oscar if Clint Eastwood's film wins best picture.\nThe critics said: \"American Sniper hinges on Cooper's restrained yet deeply expressive lead performance, allowing many of the drama's unspoken implications to be read plainly in the actor's increasingly war-ravaged face. Cooper, who packed on 40 pounds for the role, is superb here; full of spirit and down-home charm early on, he seems to slip thereafter into a sort of private agony that only those who have truly served their country can know.\" Justin Chang, Variety.\nAge: 38\nNominated for: The Imitation Game\nThe character: Alan Turing, the computer pioneer who played a key role in cracking the Enigma code used by the Nazis during World War Two.\nOscar record: This is a first nomination for Cumberbatch.\nThe critics said: \"With a large dose of Sherlock and a sprinkling of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, Benedict Cumberbatch is just brilliant in the role of Alan Turing, the Second World War codebreaker in The Imitation Game.

Unlike the UK arm of Laiki Bank, Bank of Cyprus UK is a full UK subsidiary and is regulated by the PRA.\nOn average, Laiki customers in the UK have \u00a318,000 in their accounts.\nAbout 5% of customers have more than \u00a385,000, according to Bank of Cyprus UK.\nAny money above that amount would not be guaranteed by the UK compensation scheme, but the Bank of England confirmed that all deposits had been moved to Bank of Cyprus UK.\n\"This is a good thing for customers,\" said a Bank of England spokesperson.\n\"Some of the deposits may be uninsured, but they have all been transferred,\" she said.\nSpeaking at the launch of the PRA, the Chancellor, George Osborne, paid tribute to one of its first decisions.\n\"In your very first day in existence, you sorted out a banking problem without having to come to me and ask for British taxpayers' money. And long may that continue,\" he said.\nAuthorities in Cyprus are in the process of winding up the Laiki Bank. \"Good\" parts of the bank are being transferred to Bank of Cyprus.\nUK customers of the Laiki Bank whose accounts are overdrawn will not be allowed to transfer their money to Bank of Cyprus UK.\nTheir accounts will be frozen, said the PRA.\nThose with mortgages or loans from Laiki Bank will see them transferred to Bank of Cyprus, not in the UK, but in Cyprus itself.\nSuch customers are advised to continue making payments as usual.\nThose whose current or deposit accounts are being transferred to Bank of Cyprus UK are being told to contact their new bank with any questions.\n\nOptions:\nA.

Do not provide any explanation.\n\nDocument:\nDubbed Concord 2.0, the jet would be capable of flying more than four times the speed of sound.\nDocuments lodged with the US Patent Office refer to an \"ultra-rapid air vehicle and related method for aerial locomotion\".\nSo are we on the verge of a revolution in air transport?\nAccording to the documents, the jet would reach speeds as high as Mach 4.5, or four-and-a-half times the speed of sound. That compares to Mach 2 for Concorde.\nThe patent application says that the aeroplane would use a variety of engines that would serve different purposes and power would come from hydrogen stored onboard.\nTwo turbojets under the fuselage and a rocket motor in the rear would be used during take-off. It would lift off vertically like a Space Shuttle.\nOnce launched, the turbojets would be shut down and retracted and the rocket motor would then kick in to climb to an altitude of more than 100,000 feet.\nThen ramjets, more usually used on missiles, would be ignited and the flight would reach a top speed of Mach 4.5.\nPatentYogi, a website dedicated to explaining patent ideas, said the flight path of the jet would make it the \"highest rollercoaster ride in the world\".\nThe jet would come with hammock-like seats  for passengers to sit in - necessary if they wanted to travel in comfort.\nTravellers wouldn't have to share the cabin with hundreds of others - the patent application describes it as more of a private jet carrying just 20 passengers at a time.\nThe idea would also not be limited to commercial flights. In the patent, Airbus also lists military applications for the jet.\nAirbus took the iconic Concorde out of service in 2003 because of high operating costs.\nIn the 1970s, the supersonic jet faced complaints about the sonic booms and noise pollution created by its four turbojet engines.\nAs a result it was banned from operating over land and was never able to become financially viable, operating instead as a high-altitude transatlantic taxi service for the super-rich.\nThe patent application for the new jet does address the issue of sonic booms. By climbing almost vertically the new design's sonic boom would be dissipated in all directions and not reach the ground.\nAnd the design has echoes of the curves of Concorde, with what is described as a \"gothic delta wing\".\nDon't get too excited yet.\nA vast number of patent applications don't ever see the light of day as real products although technology described in it may find its way into some Airbus products.\nAirbus itself was certainly playing down the patents, saying in a statement that the designs were based on \"concepts and ideas in a very nascent stage of conceptualisation\".\nIn fact the idea was first published in 2011 and has only now started being publicised because it has won approval from the US Patent Office.\nBack then Airbus, then known as the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), said it would take 30 to 40 years to enter service, if at all.\nAirbus did say that it is working on two hypersonic projects, one with Japanese partners and another with Russian and Australian involvement, with the aim of conquering speeds up to Mach 6.\n\nOptions:\nA. Airbus has submitted a patent for a jet called Concord 2.0, which could fly at speeds of up to Mach 4.5, using various engines and featuring a unique design that aims to address sonic boom issues, while also being suitable for both commercial and military use, although it remains uncertain if this concept will ever come to fruition.\nB. The weather forecast predicts rain and thunderstorms in the northeast region this weekend.\nC. Airbus has won a patent for a hypersonic passenger plane which could potentially fly from London to New York in an hour.\nD. Airbus is patenting a fast plane.\n\nResponse:",

Charities should be careful about political activity related to the EU referendum.\nB. The Charity Commission has issued guidance stating that political activities by charities, particularly regarding the EU referendum on June 23, must align with their charitable goals, be proportionate, and involve transparency about funding sources, as failure to adhere to these guidelines could lead to reputational risks and regulatory scrutiny for charity trustees.\nC.

Respond with only the letter of the correct answer followed by a period. Do not provide any explanation.\n\nDocument:\nPlayers' instincts are to do whatever is best for them. Even rigging the Ryder Cup qualifying process to lure more stars to Paris is not enough for some to change schedules.\nYes, the French Open field can boast four times major winner Rory McIlroy and Masters Champion Danny Willett, but the likes of Sergio Garcia, Justin Rose and last week's victor in Germany, Henrik Stenson are absent.\nThis must be a source of disappointment to the Tour and it's chief executive, Keith Pelley. After all, they have compromised the integrity of Ryder Cup qualifying in trying to produce the strongest possible field.\nPoints earned at Le Golf National will be doubled for the tables that determine the European team that defends the trophy at Hazeltine this September. The winner receives 64 points on the world ranking list and a million points on the European list.\nThe leading four players on the order of merit based European table and the top five from the world ranking standings create the nine automatic qualifiers.\nFurthermore, for the first time there are no points on offer at the World Golf Championships event in Akron, Ohio which is also being played this week.\nThis is the European Tour standing up to its more powerful American counterparts, but at what cost?\nThey have played politics against the PGA Tour and with the qualifying tables but Darren Clarke's line up may be adversely affected.\nIf Ireland's Shane Lowry were to successfully defend his WGC title he would receive no qualifying credit despite beating a higher ranked field than whoever wins the French Open.\nThe same goes for Rose, Scotland's Russell Knox, Sweden's David Lingmerth and Soren Kjeldsen, of Denmark.\nIt is fair to say Clarke would want players capable of winning tournaments headlined by the likes of Jason Day and Jordan Spieth in his team. In his heyday, it was winning these sort of events that helped make the captain a fixture in the Ryder Cup team.\nOf course, the skipper will take due note and successful Europeans in Ohio would do their chances of a wildcard pick no harm at all.  But this might mean Clarke having to use a pick on someone who would otherwise have qualified automatically.\nThere is something rather unsettling about manipulating the qualification process for a mainstay as important as the Ryder Cup to boost a single tournament.\nBut the Tour clearly felt it was necessary to ensure the French Open did not suffer unduly when a World Golf Championships event was scheduled at the same time.\nThis clash was brought about because of golf's return to the Olympics.  It meant there was no room for the WGC in its usual early August slot between the Open and PGA Championship.\nAnd here is another area where players are putting themselves first rather than their sport.\nThe growing list of Rio absentees from the men's tournament is threatening to undermine the credibility of golf's regained Olympic status.\nMcIlroy's withdrawal from the Irish team because of his fears over the Zika virus was swiftly followed by South African Branden Grace. They join Vijay Singh, Marc Leishman, Adam Scott, Louis Oosthuizen and Charl Schwartzel in choosing to stay away.\nIt is hard to criticise anyone who cites health fears, especially Leishman whose wife has a compromised immune system following serious illness last year.\nHowever it does feel as though the male golfers are out of step with pretty much the rest of the Olympic movement despite assurances that the Zika threat is low.\nThe tournament takes place in winter when there are few mosquitoes and the course is close to the sea which again minimises the threat.\nMembers of the International Olympic Committee will not be impressed when they assess golf's right to stay in the Games next year. \"I think it is appalling,\" Canadian representative Barry Maister told a New Zealand radio station.\n\"Once they've got in, they have got to deliver. Just getting in with your name, and then putting up some second or third rate players, is so far from the Olympic ideal or the expectation of the Olympic Movement.\n\"The Olympics is about the best, and they pledged the best. Quite frankly, any sport that cannot deliver its best athletes, in my view, should not be there.\"\nSignificantly, no women have withdrawn from the Olympics. They are the ones in most need of the exposure the Games will provide.\nBy turning up to play they are acting in their own best interests and in that regard they are no different to their male counterparts.\n\nOptions:\nA. The French Open has some star players, but many others are missing.\nB. The European Tour have thrown everything at bolstering this week's centenary French Open but with only partial success which, along with the latest Olympic withdrawals, serves to highlight the selfish nature of professional golfers.\nC. Cats are great pets because they are independent and require little maintenance.\nD. The European Tour has attempted to enhance the appeal of the centenary French Open by manipulating the Ryder Cup qualifying process, yet the absence of several prominent players and the withdrawals from the Olympic tournament reveal a trend of self-interest among professional golfers, which could potentially threaten the integrity of both events.\n\nResponse:",

He has proved this year that he is a special talent.'\"\nBy BBC Radio Leeds' Dave Callaghan\n\"Zafar Ansari's inclusion in the England Test squad for the winter series against Pakistan was richly deserved, although a thumb injury has cast doubt on his involvement.\n\"In taking more than 40 wickets with his left-arm spin, Ansari has bowled with great skill and control and has worked really well in tandem with Gareth Batty.\n\"With the bat, Ansari has scored more than 700 Championship runs at the top of the order, but he also averaged more than 40 in the T20 Blast.\n\"His bowling and batting were also a key component in Surrey's journey to Lord's for the One-Day Cup final, which sadly he missed because of his injury.\"\nBy BBC London 94.9's Mark Church\n\"The Middlesex pace bowler skittled Durham almost single-handedly at Lord's early in May, in a display which in one half-hour saw five wickets fall for just nine runs.\n\"Starting with a bang, Harris has been relentless all season, second only to Chris Rushworth in the total wickets tally in Division One, and his recent five-for against champions Yorkshire gave further evidence that he can mix with the best of them.\n\"It's a far cry from last year when he found himself unable to feature regularly in the Championship side, and was sent back on loan to his old club Glamorgan to get overs under his belt.\n\"At only 25, and with the ability to score crucial lower-order runs, if Harris continues to mature at the rate he currently is, further honours may well follow.\"\nBy BBC Sport's Isabelle Westbury\n\"Tom Curran has been outstanding for Surrey this season. With more than 60 Championship wickets at an average of just 24, he has led the attack and delivered for the team on a consistent basis.\n\"At times he has simply destroyed top-order batsmen with his pace and movement, and with the white ball he has also shown tremendous skill and a very cool head for one so young.\n\"With the bat he has made valuable runs in all forms of the game and has shown he is a genuine all-rounder.\n\"Curran has only missed one game this season when he was rested for a T20 match and has bowled nearly 500 overs in Championship cricket. He qualifies for England at the end of October, so how he was not included in the Lions T20 squad for the winter is quite beyond me.\"\nBy BBC London 94.9's Mark Church\n\"This Rambo bandanaman, headhunted by Yorkshire in 2012, is a dead-cert consistent wicket-taker in first-class cricket and shows real class with the new ball.\n\"His pace is not in vogue with the England selectors, but his full-length attacking attitude and nagging accuracy should not be underestimated.\n\"After 68 Championship wickets last season, Brooks has also proved he is no one-season wonder and will again be a key figure as Yorkshire target a third successive title in 2016.\"\nBy BBC Sport's Isabelle Duncan\n\"Despite being overlooked for England at any level this season, Chris Rushworth has carried on regardless, doing what he does best, which is taking wickets.\n\"He goes from strength to strength year on year and has again bowled more overs than anyone else in the country - having done the same last year as well.\n\"He's difficult for batsmen to get away because of the way he moves the ball around. And those who think he only gets his wickets at home - think again.\n\"Of his 83 Championship wickets, 41 were taken at Chester-le-Street and 42 away. Those northern wickets, eh?\"\nBy BBC Newcastle's Martin Emmerson\nCompiled by Paul Grunill\n*Statistics correct prior to final round of County Championship fixtures\n\nOptions:\nA.

The 200-plus additions to the software come as it is being investigated by the US road safety regulator.\nA Tesla driver was killed in May when the car he was driving hit a lorry that had been turning left - Autopilot was unable to spot the white trailer against the bright sky.\nNo date has been announced for the conclusion of the investigation, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration told the BBC.\nIn a call with reporters, Mr Musk said the NHTSA appeared to be \u201chappy\u201d with the Autopilot update.\nMr Musk will hope that the update will appease those critical of Tesla's introduction of the self-driving technology.\nIn July, a consumer rights group in the US accused Tesla of an \u201caggressive rollout of self-driving technology\u201d. It urged Tesla to rename the technology as it felt \u201cautopilot\u201d was \u201cmisleading and dangerous\u201d.\nThe updates to Autopilot, Mr Musk said, will give the car the ability to make greater use of the radar to spot potential dangers.\n\"After careful consideration, we now believe it can be used as a primary control sensor without requiring the camera to confirm visual image recognition,\u201d Mr Musk wrote in a blog post.\nThe challenge in using radar is in avoiding \u201cfalse alarms\u201d, he added, where small objects like cans could be interpreted as a threat.\nOverhead signs or bridges can also be misinterpreted if the road dips. To combat this, Tesla cars are going to be used to \u201clearn\u201d about the road.\n\"Initially, the vehicle fleet will take no action except to note the position of road signs, bridges and other stationary objects, mapping the world according to radar,\u201d Mr Musk wrote.\n\"The car computer will then silently compare when it would have braked to the driver action and upload that to the Tesla database.\n\"If several cars drive safely past a given radar object, whether Autopilot is turned on or off, then that object is added to the geocoded whitelist.\u201d\nTesla did not give a date for the Autopilot update to be rolled out. The radar hardware has been a part of the company\u2019s cars since October 2014.\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook\n\nOptions:\nA. Tesla is changing its cars.\nB. Tesla will update its cars' Autopilot function with new safety features designed to prevent collisions, the company has announced.\nC. Elephants are known for their excellent memory and social structures in the wild.\nD. Elon Musk announced that Tesla cars will soon enhance their Autopilot functionality by incorporating improved radar systems to detect obstacles, ensuring drivers remain attentive while driving, and addressing safety concerns following a fatal incident earlier this year, as well as ongoing investigations by the US road safety regulator.\n\nResponse:",

Just because we went to France, it doesn't mean Russia is less important,\" he said.\n\"If you see the film [Don't Take Me Home, the Wales Euro 2016 documentary], it gives you a taste for it again. You want to be back in that environment so I'm desperate to do it again. Desperate. It's the only word I can use.\n\"I'm desperate to go back, be in the middle of that type of pressure. I can't describe to you how that felt. I absolutely want that again. I do. That's all I think about.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nColeman and his players have openly admitted how difficult they found the aftermath of Euro 2016, plunged into an emotional comedown after the searing highs of France.\nThey re-watched goals and games, text messaged each other occasionally - all to try and reproduce the magic of that summer.\nThat is the aim of this World Cup qualifying campaign but, with four points separating Group D leaders Ireland and third-placed Wales, Coleman's men travel to Dublin in need of victory.\nColeman has previously said he would consider his position if Wales were out of contention after five games.\nWith four matches gone, however, he is putting that discussion to one side.\n\"I think until it's mathematically impossible, I'll always, and we've always, got to look at it and go: 'We've got a chance',\" the 46-year-old adds.\n\"So unless we can't finish top and we can't finish second, if that happens, then I'll see how I feel and Wales will see how they feel, I imagine, because it is my last campaign.\"\nWales' match against the Republic of Ireland has the ingredients of a titanic battle - a big and noisy crowd, two teams familiar with each other from countless Premier League skirmishes, and the significance of precious qualifying points to play for.\nThere are echoes of Wales' Euro 2016 group meeting with England - their only defeat in France before losing to Portugal in the semi-finals - and Coleman hopes his team will have learned from their mistakes in Lens.\n\"We went 1-0 up and then we wished our life away, rather than just enjoying those moments,\" he explains.\n\"It's the same for the Republic of Ireland - 50,000 people in the Aviva Stadium, they're top, everyone is billing it as a must-win game for us. But the game will come and go. It only lasts 90 minutes.\n\"The build-up beforehand goes on a lot longer than the game itself. I think you forget sometimes when you're in it that you've got to enjoy it, the players have got to enjoy it on the pitch, and they'll do that if they do what they're good at.\n\"We can't miss the game - we did that I think against England. We were disappointed after the England game because it was a British derby and there was so much surrounding it, and we got sucked into that.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nColeman admits he was crestfallen after the England game, so much so, he broke one of his own rules.\n\"It was a dry camp, we were together seven weeks. No alcohol - staff or players. But I had a double whiskey by myself, a sneaky one out on the balcony,\" he confides.\n\"As a manager you have to look at yourself and I thought I was preaching all the time, don't get sucked into this game to England.\n\"So I was devastated, not because it was England, but we are at a tournament, it is the second game, we had a point in the bag and with four points we were going through really. But we let it slip.\n\"I was absolutely gutted.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nColeman hopes it will be a different story this time.\n\"It's all about us, not worrying about ifs and buts and what happens if we don't do this,\" he says.\n\"It's all about preparation, sticking to our game plan - if the players stick to that and we lose it's my fault.

Respond with only the letter of the correct answer followed by a period. Do not provide any explanation.\n\nDocument:\nEleesa Dadiani owns and runs an art gallery in London's famous Cork Street. She was born in Georgia in the Caucasus and was \"breastfed by gypsies\".\nBut she is also a passionate believer in the power of Bitcoin and other digital currencies.\nWhen we meet she is busy preparing for an exhibition of sculptures made from the exhausts of former Formula 1 racing cars.\nOne of these strange rib-cage-like creations made from the super-strong alloy inconel has been gold-plated and will sell for about \u00c2\u00a335,000.\n\"These are pieces of history,\" she tells me.\nIn a first for the tradition-bound art world of Cork Street, her international clientele will have the opportunity to pay using Bitcoin, the digital cryptocurrency underpinned by blockchain technology.\nThe gallery will also accept other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Dash, Litecoin, and soon, Monero, she says.\nWhy?\n\"This is not a demand-driven decision at all, it's intuitive based on the way things are going,\" she says.\nShe believes paying by cryptocurrency will become as normal as paying by cash or credit card. She also hopes it will attract a new, non-traditional type of art investor.\nBlockchain, the underlying technology, is a digital ledger or record of transactions that is distributed across, and verified by, thousands of computers in a network.\nOnce the network has reached a consensus that a transaction has happened, the ledger is updated and cannot be tampered with.\n\"Blockchain is a borderless, open source, decentralised peer-to-peer network that governments cannot shut down,\" she says. \"For me, the blockchain is going to be the biggest thing since the internet.\"\nAnd the fact that there is no centralised body - like a bank head office, for example - makes cryptocurrencies safer, she argues, despite their reputation for being volatile, high-risk and the favourite \"store of value\" for criminals and hackers.\nBitcoin payments can be anonymous and potentially beyond the grasp of tax authorities, but this isn't the reason she's offering payment by cryptocurrency, she assures me.\nSo how easy is it to accept a Bitcoin payment?\n\"It's really very simple,\" she explains. \"I give the client my public key [a long string of letters and numbers] and they use that to send bitcoin to my account from their digital wallet or bitcoin exchange,\" she says.\n\"My wallet is linked to my personal bank so I can then convert those bitcoins into pounds, euros or dollars.\"\nMs Dadiani is such a fan of cryptocurrencies - she trades in them as well - that she is launching her own version, Dadicoin, later this year.\nThe $60bn art world in general is warming to the potential of cryptocurrencies, partly because of blockchain's dual ability to establish the provenance of works of art and thereby reduce the reliance on brokers and other middlemen.\nMarcelo Garcia Casil, for example, is chief executive and co-founder of Maecenas, an online marketplace that will enable art owners to sell shares in their expensive works of art (worth more than $1m) and raise money far more cheaply than they could though a bank.\nAnd the owners also get to keep possession of their artworks while sharing up to 49% of the ownership.\nInvestors, who ordinarily wouldn't be able to afford multi-million-dollar works of art, will be able buy shares or units in the work using cryptocurrency. They will then be able to sell these units later in the marketplace. Each transaction is recorded cryptographically on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\"We want to make fine art accessible for everyone,\" says Mr Casil, who was born in Argentina, now lives in Singapore, and has a background in investment banking.\n\"The old auction houses like Christie's and Sotheby's have controlled the art market for centuries, so we think the opportunity for disruption is huge.\"\nEstablishing the authenticity of works of art is critical to their value, and this will still need to be done by skilled professionals, admits Mr Casil.\n\"But once the provenance has been recorded in the blockchain, you never have to do it again,\" he says. This takes a lot of cost out of the system.\nMaecenas has already attracted works of art worth $100m (\u00c2\u00a377m; 86m euros) in total, says Mr Casil, and the marketplace is due for launch in September.\nThe art world has been flirting with Bitcoin for a few years now, despite the likes of auction house Sotheby's saying they have no plans to accept the currency.\nIn April 2015, the Austrian Museum of Applied Art/Contemporary Art (MAK) was the first museum in the world to buy a work of art using Bitcoin.\nDutch artist Harm van den Dorpel created a limited-edition screensaver that was cryptographically authenticated through blockchain.\nAnd online gallery Cointemporary exhibits digital artworks by international contemporary artists that can only be bought with Bitcoin. Purchases are handled by Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange.\nBlockchain establishes the chain of ownership, preventing anyone from stealing or tampering with the work.\nBut will Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ever really become a mainstream alternative to traditional money?\nViews differ widely.\nIn Japan, there is a big move to equip 260,000 retail locations with bitcoin capability, and a few high-street retailers, such as Lush, have opted to accept the currency.\nBut Joe Pindar, a director at cyber-security company Gemalto, says: \"At present there are very few businesses accepting bitcoin as a payment method - less than 1% of all retailers.\n\"The biggest barrier to adoption is the length of time it takes to settle a payment in person, with transactions taking tens of minutes.\nDespite this, Mr Pindar says several large retailers have been experimenting with the cryptocurrency, but may choose \"to adopt bitcoin for online purchases only, where time to process a payment is less important.\"\nThe currency's volatility is an issue - the value of one bitcoin topped $3,000 in June, before crashing to below $1,900 in July - and transactions are taking longer and longer to process.\nThis is largely to do with the rules governing how Bitcoin works, and there is currently a big row over how the issue should be resolved.\nIt could be that blockchain proves to be more important to the art world than its flashier Bitcoin offspring.\n\nOptions:\nA. Eleesa Dadiani, who runs an art gallery in London, is embracing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for art transactions, believing that this could change the traditional art market by allowing international clients to pay with digital currencies while also launching her own cryptocurrency, Dadicoin, later this year.\nB. Eleesa Dadiani enjoys making sandwiches in her gallery every day.\nC. The art world is interested in Bitcoin.\nD. Why is the art world getting excited about digital currency Bitcoin and its underlying technology blockchain?\n\nResponse:",

But company branding would not be banned.\nIt would also ban strong flavours such as menthol or vanilla, which can mask the bitter tobacco taste.\nThe revisions to the EU's 2001 tobacco directive could become law in 2014.\n\"Tobacco products should look and taste like tobacco products,\" said EU Health Commissioner Tonio Borg, presenting the proposals.\nThe current requirement for health warnings on packets is 30% minimum coverage on one side and 40% on the other.\nThe new packaging requirements would also apply to roll-your-own tobacco.\nThe legislation would allow member states the option of plain, non-branded packaging \"in duly justified cases\".\nWords like \"light\", \"mild\" and \"low tar\" are deemed to be misleading and would be banned.\nThe Commission says packets must be big enough to ensure full visibility for the health warnings, so the recommendation is at least 20 cigarettes per pack.\nFourteen EU states already have 20 as the minimum, four stipulate a minimum of 19, and in the UK and Italy the minimum is 10. It is also argued that bigger, more expensive packets are less attractive to young smokers.\nThe EU would maintain its ban on chewing tobacco - called snus.

Her debts are piling up, from health insurance to her daughter's college tuition.\n\"I have bills to pay every month, so I thought getting a job as a maid would be the solution,\" she says.\n\"I don't have formal experience, but I do this sort of work in my own home. So why not?\"\nBrazil is going through its worst recession in more than two decades.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts the country's economy will have contracted by almost 8% in two years by the end of 2016.\nBrazil soared in the past decade, as one of the emerging Brics economies, when its commodities were hot property in the international markets.\nBut with China slowing down and commodity prices reaching record lows, Brazil's economy went into reverse at high speed last year.\nPresident Dilma Rousseff - from the governing Workers' Party - tried to delay the effects of the recession in the labour market and pumped stimulus money into the economy through tax breaks and subsidies.\nBut now those policies, intended to protect workers, are doing the exact opposite.\nBrazil's debt grew, and the country lost its investment-grade credit rating as well as consumer and investor confidence.\nAnd workers' situations have deteriorated rapidly in the past few months.\nIn just one year, the number of unemployed people jumped 41% - from 6.4 million people to 9.1 million.\nBrazil went from a situation some economists consider full employment, back in early 2014, to 9% unemployment now.\nWages increased in that period, but inflation rose almost twice as fast, so most workers are now worse off.\nA closer look at Brazil's economy reveals some worrying trends.\nDomestic workers are a symbol of that change.\nBrazil is the country with the highest number of domestic workers in the world. Six million people - more than 90% of them women - work as maids.\nA few years ago, when Brazil's economy was flourishing and the country needed workers to fill all the new jobs, women began leaving domestic service to work in industry and shops.\nIn 2011, Brazil's Finance Minister hailed domestic workers as a \"sub-utilised\" labour reserve - an army of women who could gain skills and enter the job market filling better roles, with higher wages.\nAnd that really did happen.\nFrom 2007 until last year, the percentage of people working in domestic jobs fell - from about 8% of Brazil's workforce to below 6%.\nMiddle-income families were left with the choice of either paying higher wages to their maids or doing their own cooking and cleaning.\nBut now there are signs that this trend is in reverse.\nMore women are finding themselves in Mrs Souza's position: losing their jobs in industry and commerce and moving into less skilled jobs with lower wages, many of them returning to roles they thought they had left behind.\nSimone Fernandes spent Brazil's boom years working in a supermarket. She thought her days as a maid were over, but now she is back working for a middle-class family.\n\"Back then things were getting better,\" she says.\n\"You had many job offers. You knew that when you left a job, you'd be quickly employed less than a month later.\n\"Also, you could go to your boss and he would give you counteroffers. But that was then. Now, you have to be happy to just have a job.\"\nDaniele Kuipers, who set up Casa and Cafe, a website that helps maids find jobs, says the number of women offering their services grew a staggering 92% last year, as Brazil's recession deepened.\nBut the demand for domestic servants did not grow.\nMiddle-income families are cutting their expenses because of the crisis too.\nDuring the boom years, Brazil updated its domestic service laws, increasing protection for formal workers.\nThis should have been good news - but, in the current recession, it has only increased costs for hiring maids formally.\nAs a result, Fernando Souza, owner of the Prendas Domesticas job agency, says, there is huge growth in the number of informal domestic workers, who get lower wages and are not collecting their social security payments.\nThis growth in black market jobs is a trend for all workers in Brazil, not just maids. In one year, Brazil lost one million formal jobs.\nBrazil's prolonged recession is having dire consequences for the poorer classes.\nMrs Fernandes and her husband had to sell their car and move into a smaller flat.\nThey are working longer hours - but, with prices rising on a monthly basis, their standard of living is declining rapidly.\nThere may be one silver lining, though, for some of these families who were emerging socially but are now sinking again.\nDuring Brazil's good years, both Mrs Souza and Mrs Fernandes managed to get their children through college.\nThat means the next generation of workers may be more skilled than the current one.\nBrazil's challenge for the future will be to create new skilled jobs for them.\nAdditional reporting by Ruth Costas, BBC Brasil.\n\nOptions:\nA. The weather in Brazil is usually sunny and warm, making it a great vacation destination.\nB.
