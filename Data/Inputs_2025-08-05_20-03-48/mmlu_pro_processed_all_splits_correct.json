No, because without blinding, there is a strong chance of a placebo effect.\nD. No, because grade level is a lurking variable which may well be confounded with the variables under consideration.\nE. No, because while this design may point out an association between reading and GPA, it cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship.\nF.
